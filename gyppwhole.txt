Very
Hahhaa,
very
I
share
your
impressions
I
miss
Sara
Haha,
everybody
miss
Sara
Have
you
guys
already
thought
about
where
to
go?Hahaha
I
thought
about
it
in
the
begining
when
it
was
me
oriented
to
go
to
belarus;
but
now
i
don’t
know
if
it
will
be
useful
to
go
to
austria
regarding
our
project
and
work
I
was
thinking
about
croatia,
as
guys
there
really
know
what
are
they
doing
(my
job
related)
Project
related
i
would
choose
austria
I
think
I
will
go
to
Austria
so
you
will
need
to
translate
my
CV
Marianne
Haha
You
can
pay
me
in
drinks
Yei
we
are
waiting
Haha,
I’m
in
Sold
Maybe
we
should
go
somewhere
together
teambuilding
We
should
for
sure
make
some
project
meeting
in
some
of
the
OpCos
I
can
also
do
individual
learning
one
week
in
belarus
and
one
week
for
us
to
do
a
project
meeting
and
week
together
in
cro
or
serb
for
example
Proud
to
present
my
mentor
Overall
great
and
a
smart
guy
with
15+
years
of
experience
in
web
dev
and
analytics
Cool
Hey
guys
do
you
also
use
the
web
dropbox
version
Cause
i
cant
download
it
with
the
company
laptop
Yes,
I
also
don't
have
an
admin
rights
on
my
work
laptop
Ok
just
wanted
to
make
sure
i
don't
do
anything
wrong
Btw
impressive
mentor
congratulations
Thanks
he
can
help
everyone
here
I
believe
I
started
to
fill
this
out
for
us
-
please
add
your
comments
thoughts
especially
for
the
culture
and
project
development
at
the
bottom.
It
is
not
urgent
though
as
we
need
it
at
the
first
check-in
We
don't
have
a
meeting
today
or?
I
think
we
have
one
Damn
i
forgot
to
ask
who
will
represent
our
team
on
tuesday?
On
Wednesday?
Check
in?
Yes
I
wont
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
call,
sry
We
just
have
to
align
on
what
would
we
like
to
communicate
there.
If
someone
has
a
wish
to
present
just
raise
you
hands
I
wouldn’t
mind
to
do
it
if
no
one
else
does
Cool
Probably
we
should
communicate
content
of
that
email
we
plan
on
sending
plus
our
concerns
about
the
time
and
project
we
can
add
our
comments
to
some
file
on
dropbox
or
via
mail
Who
is
going
to
meet
irene
and
mario
this
week
Was
is
croatia
I
am
just
writing
the
email
to
them
Hrvoje
and
me.
Also
if
anyone
has
some
questions
we
could
ask
them
in
person
Probably
that
is
easier
than
via
mail
Thanks
for
the
mail
You
wrapped
it
in
a
great
way
